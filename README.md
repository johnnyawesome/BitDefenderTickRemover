## The Problem 

Bitdefender puts green ticks next to every single one of your search results:

![Bit Defender Green Ticks](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/BitDefenderTickRemover/blob/master/BitDefenderTicks.jpg)

This is of course completely unnecessary. Why?

Because if a site is deemed malicious, BitDefender will put a *red exclamation mark* next to it.

I don't have to know when a site is safe. Bit I'd like to know when it's unsafe.
This Userscript does just that for you.

Use at your own risk.

## How to run the script

There are several possibilities to run it:
 - The easiest way is to use [TamperMonkey ](https://www.google.ch/search?q=tampermonkey) which is available for [Firefox ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) and [Chrome ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/tampermonkey), even for [Opera ](https://addons.opera.com/de/search/?query=Tampermonkey)
 ### With Tampermonkey installed,  [click here to immediately install the script! Easy! ðŸ˜‰](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/BitDefenderTickRemover/raw/master/BitDefenderTickRemover/BitDefenderTickRemover.user.js)
